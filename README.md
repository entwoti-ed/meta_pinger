## MetaPinger

[MetaPinger](http://metapinger.herokuapp.com/) is a simple, one-model Heroku app that pings other Heroku apps (and itself) at 10-minute intervals to keep the service's free servers from idling.

#### Why?
Because idle servers can embarrass you when you're trying to show off your student apps in front of potential employers, and you don't want to be embarrassed in front of potential employers.

#### Technologies Used

- Ruby 2.0.0
- Rails 3.2.14
- Rake 
- Heroku Scheduler
